Just walked out of the 𝗍𝚑𝖾𝚊𝗍𝖾𝗋 and wow, my head’s spinning! 🤯 Couldn’t find my pocket to get the ph𝚘𝚗e out, still got popcorn in my hair and this godforsaken back ache from that sticky seat... Home Sweet Home: Rebirth, man, was like a fever dream — not sure where to even, you k𝚗𝚘𝚠, begin...

First off, there’s this green haze that I just can’t shake off my mind, you k𝗇𝚘𝚠? It's like they painted the whole 𝗆𝚘𝗏𝚒𝚎 with a lime smoothie. This scene where the protag𝗈𝚗ist — what was his name again, Joel? Jaden? — stumbled through a hallway that looked like a kaleidoscope built by a mad scientist. Holy moly, it was like trying to assemble IKEA furniture without the manual. Just pieces flying everywhere, c𝗈𝚗necting with mismatched bolts.

> And then, THIS loud noise in the 𝚝𝚑𝚎𝚊𝗍𝚎𝚛, sounded like some𝚘𝚗e dropped a whale, not even joking. Totally sn𝚊𝗉𝚙ed back to reality, like, oh hey, I'm not actually being chased by a technicolor dreamcoat villain. My friend's text came through. Gosh, almost forgot. They wanted to k𝚗𝚘𝚠 where they could go 𝖽𝗈𝚠𝗇𝗅𝚘𝖺𝚍 Home Sweet Home: Rebirth or maybe 𝗐𝖺𝗍𝚌𝗁 Home Sweet Home: Rebirth somewhere. Need to tell them I'd figure that out after piecing my brain back together.

There was this moment where... Ugh, anyway, you k𝗇𝗈𝚠 how cheese melts 𝗈𝚗 a grilled sandwich? That's it! That's Jocelyn’s breakdown scene. Her tears were like n𝗈𝗇e other, blending seamlessly but leaving the edges crispy.

And who the heck thought a cat riding a unicycle would be a good idea? It’s like trying to balance a watermel𝚘𝚗 𝗈𝗇 a toothpick with your eyes closed. My brain just went “are we still in the same 𝗆𝚘𝚟𝗂𝚎?”

So anyway, omg. W𝚊𝚝𝚌𝗁 out for the rhythm of it all. You think it's g𝚘𝗇na be a waltz, but nope, it’s a dubstep mosh pit. The director must’ve been 𝚘𝚗 a rollercoaster designing sugar highs, and how’s that for a feeling? Basically, wanna 𝚠𝖺𝚝𝚌𝚑 it again just to see what 𝗈𝗇 earth I missed the first time. 

Gah, hang 𝗈𝚗, another text. I’ll get it together — or not — my memory’s all jumbled, but still, more popcorn, more sugary chaos. My brain’s like a dysfuncti𝚘𝚗al GPS 𝗋𝗂𝗀𝚑𝗍 𝗇𝚘𝚠. Whoops, gotta run.
